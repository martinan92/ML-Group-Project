# ML-Group-Project

This project focussed on creating a classification model for Driven Data's "Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table" (https://bit.ly/2ufwfTW). Here we utilized a model stacking ensemble that included Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting Tree models. Full code and final writeup can be found in the Group 0-1-6 folder.
